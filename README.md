**Packetskipper/Packetblocker**
This is a fabric 1.21 test mod for holding back certain packets like hunger loss, damage and the restriction of breaking blocks where not allowed.
It is a test mod, so for example _net.yourname.packetblocker_ should be replaced with your own domain, but this is just a TEST, REMEMBER?
